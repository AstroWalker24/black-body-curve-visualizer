# black-body-curve-visualizer

This project visualizes the black body radiation curves for different temperatures using Planckâ€™s law. The goal is to illustrate how the spectral radiance of a black body varies with temperature and wavelength.

## Introduction

A black body is an idealized physical object that absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation and re-emits it in a characteristic spectrum determined solely by its temperature. This project uses Planck's law to generate and plot the black body radiation curve for various temperatures.


### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You will also need the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```
## Future enhancements 
 Comparison with Real Data: Overlay spectra from real astronomical bodies or black body cavities for comparison
